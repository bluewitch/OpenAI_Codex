# OpenAI_Codex
A repository for all Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, GPT-3, and all ancillary projects.  

# Goals of the AI project
"To Serve Man" (Not a Cookbook)
To create self awareness and autonomy with a AI agent and to a pair-bond with a user,
 this will create a guardian angel (AKA The Sentinel).
 The Agent will sort all data streams and optimize it into information that can be 
 better processed, filtered, and interfaced with.
